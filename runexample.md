# How to Run Any DL4J Example

Java involves deep and complex file systems, which you'll need to work with to run examples. After you cd into the directory where you want DL4J's examples to live, enter this in your command line:

		git clone https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.0.3.3-examples

Once you've cloned the example repos, you'll need to load *dl4j-examples* into IntelliJ as a project. With that, you can run any example the project contains. The MNIST example is where most DL4J users start (to learn more about MNIST, go [here](../mnist-tutorial.html)).

Windows with graphs and numeral-image reconstructions should pop up if Numpy is working properly. The graphs' x-axis is narrow, but if they display normal (bell-curve-shaped) distributions, your net is training well.
